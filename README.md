# Javascript
Code repository for learning Javascript fundamentals. The repo also consist small projects made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The tools used in the projects are just a simple code editor of your choice (I used VS Code).
If you want to see and run the projects, you can simply clone the repository in your local machine and open it in code editor of your choice.

# AI ChatBot
This is chatbot app made using HTML, CSS, Javascript in which we can ask any questions to the bot and it gives us the relevant result. 
I have used Google Gemini's API here for the responses. There are still some improvements in the project like the responses are coming in markdown file,
where the text contains '*' and '**' included in it. We can format it in a manner so that it looks exactly like we are using some AI tools.
