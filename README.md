# Javascript
Code repository for learning Javascript fundamentals. The repo also consist small projects made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The tools used in the projects are just a simple code editor of your choice (I used VS Code).
If you want to see and run the projects, you can simply clone the repository in your local machine and open it in code editor of your choice.
